What is MLOops?
-  MLOps (short for Machine Learning Operations) is a set of practices and tools that aim to streamline the development, deployment, and maintenance of machine learning (ML) models in production environments, similar to how DevOps supports software engineering.
- MLOps combines:
  - Machine Learning (ML) – developing models from data
  - DevOps – automating software deployment, monitoring, and infrastructure management

<br/>

MLOps Lifecycle:
- Design Phase
  - Clarify the context of the problem
  - Assess the added value of using Machine learning
  - Gather business requirements
  - Establish key metrics for success
  - Data Collection and ensuring high quality data processing
- Development Phase
  - Develop machine learning models
  - Experiment with data, algorithms, and hyperparameters
  - Create a  model ready for deployment
- Deployment Phase
  - Integrate the machine learning model in business
  - Deploying the model in production
  - Monitoring the performance

CI/CD Pipeline:
- Continuous Integration (CI)
  - Plan
  - Code
  - Build
  - Test
- Continuous Deployment (CD)
  - Release
  - Deploy
  - Operate
